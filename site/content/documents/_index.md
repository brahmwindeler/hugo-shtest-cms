  - title: Deed Restrictions
    description: |
      Deed restrictions are rules and regulations that govern one or more lots or parcels of land. Deed restrictions are a usage covenant (contract) bound to the property.

      You purchased your home in Spring Hill Subdivision because you liked what you saw, and so you invested your hard earned money. By doing this you also agreed to live by the conditions of our subdivisionâ€™s deed restrictions. Our deed restrictions exist to protect the quality of life in Spring Hill, and of course to protect and enhance the investments we have made in our homes. Please read and abide by them. Please assume your share of our common responsibility to maintain a high quality of life in our neighborhood.

      When all of the residents willingly help and respect the rights of others in abiding by the deed restrictions, living in Spring Hill is made better and more rewarding for everyone. This maintains both the pleasant environment and the financial advantages we enjoy from home ownership in one of the finest subdivisions in the City of Rochester Hills.

      These deed restrictions are on file with the [Oakland County Clerk/Register of Deeds](https://www.oakgov.com/clerkrod/Pages/default.aspx) (1200 N. Telegraph, Dept 480, Pontiac, MI 48341). They are provided here in digital form for your convenience.
