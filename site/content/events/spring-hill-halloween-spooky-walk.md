  This is a kid friendly Halloween walk for the little ones of Spring Hill Sub!
  Just the right amount of spooky. We encourage costumes! The entrance to the
  Spooky Walk will be at the dead end at W. Maryknoll and Braeburn.


  Although this is an outdoor event, to be overly safe, we ask that you sign-up
  for a time slot for your party. If your party is more than eight, please
  sign-up for two time slots back to back.


  This year’s candy station treats will be individually bagged. Please be sure
  kiddos only touch the bags they are taking home. There will be no cider or
  donuts this year.


  Disclaimer:  Please be advised, Spring Hill HOA is in support of and requires
  adherence to the Oakland County Health Order 2020-12 to participate in this
  event. This order states: Any individual who leaves their home or place of
  residence must wear a face covering over their nose and mouth when outdoors
  and unable to consistently maintain a distance of six feet or more from
  individuals who are not members of their household.


  Sign up for your HOA Spooky Walk experience here!


  The scheduled timing of your Spooky Walk experience should allow you to be
  able to walk through the trail without becoming within 6ft of others. The HOA
  will not be regulating walkers; therefore, it is your responsibility to ensure
  everyone in your party maintains at least 6ft between other parties. Be sure
  to bring and wear your mask in situations where it may be or is impossible to
  maintain at least 6ft distance.


  It’s Spooky Time: Enter at your own risk!
