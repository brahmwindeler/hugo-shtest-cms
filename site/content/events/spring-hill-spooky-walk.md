This is our kid friendly Holloween walk for the little ones. Just the right amount of spooky. We will be meeting up at 6ish for pictures and mingling. Walk begins as dusk falls and we are hoping to have cider and donuts. Parents if you are interested in helping set up, tear down or participate, contact Ben Galliway at bgalliway@gmail.com. Hope to see you there.
