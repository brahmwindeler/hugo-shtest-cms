Our annual HOA meeting will be at Meadow Brook Elementary in the Media Center (not the Cafeteria as in the past) on Thursday, November 8th from 7-8pm.

We will talk about the things we’ve done over the past year, current concerns in the neighborhood, etc.

We will also be holding elections, which requires paid membership dues to vote, so if you haven’t paid them for 2018 yet, do so now!

Speaking of... we are in need of new board members! Most of the current board has been on the board for several years. We will be shuffling around our officer roles this year so that we keep things somewhat fresh, but we can’t do this indefinitely. This is a great way to become active in the community and help to make our neighborhood an awesome place to live!

Agenda:

* Welcome and Introduction
* Annual Report
* Financial Report
* Election of Officers (requires paid membership dues to vote)
* Committee Updates (social, entrance signs, etc.)
* Unfinished Business
* New Business
* Adjournment

We will try to broadcast the meeting over Facebook Live, technology allowing, but of course your physical presence would be preferred! Hope to see you there!
