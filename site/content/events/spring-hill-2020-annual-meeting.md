As the school district is not renting out facilities at this time due to COVID-19, and in the interest of safety, we will be hosting our annual meeting virtually via Zoom.

We will talk about the things we’ve done over the past year, current concerns in the neighborhood, etc.

We will also be holding elections, which requires paid membership dues to vote, so if you haven’t paid them for 2020 yet, do so now!

We are in need of new board members! This is a great way to become active in the community and help to make our neighborhood an awesome place to live. Please [contact us](mailto:rhspringhillhoa@gmail.com) if you might be interested.
