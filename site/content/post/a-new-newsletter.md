Though our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SpringHillSub) group is the easiest way to stay up to date with everything that is happening in our neighborhood, we try to put out a newsletter at least once a year to keep everyone, even those people who don't use Facebook, to stay up to date with things that are happening in the neighborhood.

This issue contains information on:

* Upcoming social events
* The search for new board members
* Burn permits
* Fences
* Road resurfacing
* Committee happenings
* Dues

A digital copy of the newsletter can be found on our [documents](/documents) page or [downloaded directly](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oxoruyvvwyr7xce/Spring%20Hill%20Newsletter%202018%20Spring%20Summer.pdf?dl=0).
