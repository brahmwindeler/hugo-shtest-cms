We have been notified by the City of Rochester Hills that the streets in the south side of our neighborhood (Castlebar, Leinster, Longford, Ulster, and Munster) will be milled and resurfaced sometime between June 22 (possibly as early as June 18) through July 9.

One lane of traffic will be maintained at all times. Please be patient with construction trucks, they will do their best to not block traffic unless necessary. It is very important to have roads cleared and NO PARKING from 7am-8pm during milling and paving operations!

Be on the lookout for a city inspector to be handing out door hangers a few days ahead of work.

We will try to post information on any updates we receive from the City on this website and in the Facebook group.

For more information see the City's [Interactive Construction Map](http://www.rochesterhills.org/index.aspx?NID=252). Please feel free to contact Mr. Clark French at 248.765.6373 or Keith Depp at 248.841.2503, or the HOA for any questions you might have.
