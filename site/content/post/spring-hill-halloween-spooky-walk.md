  Join us Saturday Oct 19th at 6pm for our 2019 Spring Hill Spooky Walk. This is
  our kid friendly Holloween walk for the little ones. Just the right amount of
  spooky.

We will be meeting up at 6pm at W. Maryknoll and Braeburn for pictures and mingling. Walk begins as dusk falls and we are hoping to have cider and donuts. Parents if you are interested in helping set up, tear down or participate let Ben Galliway know. Hope to see you there.
