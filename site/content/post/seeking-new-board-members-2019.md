  This coming November, we will need new board members for the HOA as our
  current board member terms, according to the by-laws, are ending.

The past 4 years have been a labor of love for our board members. Brahm Windeler, Leah Roberts, Emily Perez (with the help of previous board members Bryan Willmert, Kim Kutschman, and Christie Catalano) have helped bring the association back from a period of inactivity in the hopes of rejuvenating a sense of community within the neighborhood. We have brought the association back in good standing with the state, created the web site, distributed newsletters, held regular membership meetings, etc.

Most recently, Ben Galliway, who organized our spooky Halloween walk last October, has stepped up as Vice President to bring some fresh ideas and energy into the mix.

Though our current board members still intend to stay active in the association, as we continue to want to see the social fabric of this neighborhood thrive, we would love to see some new faces and neighbors join the homeowners association board!

So many of you are also passionate about making our neighborhood a wonderful and desirable place to live, and serving on the HOA board is a great way to make positive change throughout the subdivision!

All board members work together, which makes the workload easier! We will need to fill all positions - President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer and ideally two Board Members at Large.
